Installation of the package
The package is composed of several M-code files that are installed in the Matlab environment using the 'package_setup' command. It provides functions for constructing complex 3D scenes by placing consecutive objects that act, in effect, like building blocks within the layout.

Download the flypath3d package and unzip it to the destination directory. Next execute configuration script:

package_setup

That's all! Your copy of flypath3d package is ready to work.

Program description and data set organization
Objects can be created using the 'new_object' function; the package allows kinematic data, 3D model geometry definitions, and display parameters to be combined into a single easy-to-use data set:

new_object(filename,matrix,varargin);

The function parameters are: output set file name ('filename'), array of kinematic data ('matrix') and some optional arguments ('varargin'). The array of kinematic data K contains three Cartesian coordinate vectors x, y, z and three angle vectors θ, ψ, φ completely describing the 3D object position in time:
